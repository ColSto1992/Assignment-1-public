<h1> My Profile </h1>
<h3> Personal Information </h3>

<p> My name is Colin Bruce Stock, I was born in Ceduna, South Australia in 1992. My parents and Grandparents were all born in Australia except my grandmother on my mother’s side who was born in the Netherlands and came to Australia in the 40s. I have a little brother who is 4 years younger than me.
</p>

<p> I grew up near the ocean in Ceduna and then when I was 8 years old, we moved to the Sunshine Coast in QLD. We were never more than a 10-minute drive away from the beach and my dad loved taking us surfing everyday even though I wasn’t too fond of it.
</p>

<p> While I lived in the Sunshine Coast, I graduated high school in 2009 and instead of going to University I decided to look for a job, I managed to get an apprentice baker position which I enjoyed and spent the next 11 years working as a baker.
