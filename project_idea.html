<h1> Project Idea </h1>

<h3><em> Overview </em></h3>

<p> The project will be an app to help you budget and cook meals, you will be able to tell the app your budget and some meals you like and the app will tell you the price of each meal as a whole, when you click on the meal it’ll give you a breakdown of what the ingredients are and how much each ingredient will cost, it will also tell you the recipe it’s using to help you make the meal. You will be able to set favourite meals and use them again later. You will also be able to input how much you spent and the app will keep track of your spending and give you a daily, weekly and monthly total of your spending. Over time it will give you averages and graphs you can use to more accurately budget.
</p>

<h3><em> Motivation </em></h3>

<p> My motivation for this app is that I always end up eating the same thing for long periods of time because I know it’s cheap and how to make it. I am also not good at budgeting my money and feel as though this app would help me diversify my eating habits as well as helping me keep track of how much I am spending on food. This project will also help me develop some IT skills while designing and making the app, I could use this experience to help me differentiate myself from other candidates when going for an entry level IT job which will eventually help me on my path to my ideal job.
</p>

<h3><em> Description </em></h3>

<p> The app will have a database of recipes and ingredients as well as the prices of ingredients. I can use a web crawler to collect the recipes from different websites and blogs and have a large collection of recipes for the user. I can use the same process for the prices, can gather information from various websites and get average prices for the ingredients that will be used.
